#PONG

As the title suggest, the project is the simple game of Pong.

1. The purpose of the game is to pass the ball to the enemy side. The score is updated whenever a player fails to hit the ball. The first player who scores 3 points wins. If a round takes too long, the ball will start to move faster. The player who wins will be shown in the lcd display.

2. The movement will be done by two buttons(up and down).

3. The game can be played by two humans, where they fight eachother, or you can chose to play against the computer(you can set it's difficulty).

4. The difficulty of the computer consists in it's speed, and it has three levels: easy, medium and hard.

5. In the lcd menu you are able to change your name, the name of the second human and the difficulty of the computer. The best player(showed in highscore section) will be the one that beat the hardest difficulty yet. If two or more players beat that difficulty, the one who lost the fewest rounds will be shown. The highscore is kept in memory. There will also be an option to reset the highscore. 

6. Browsing in the menu is done by the joystick. While browsing the menu, the matrix will play an animation that shows the word "PONG".

7. Have fun playing it!
