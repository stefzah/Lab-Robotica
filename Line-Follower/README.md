# CYBER-CAR LINE-FOLLOWER

As the title suggests, my final project is a line-follower

**Description of the project**: The car is designed to detect and follow any line that is black( or close to black). It can do 90 degree turns, U turns, it can rotate around its own axis, and if it reaches the end of a line, it goes back to where it came from.

**Hardware**:

- The power is generated by two electric motors controlled by a 4-motor driver board.
- There are two wheels that move the car, each one with its independent motor.
- A button under the car that starts the engines
- An 8-sensor line-follower that reads at all times
- A ball-point that helps the car turn
- A capable lithium battery to power the motors

**About the project**
The software behind this car is based on the ultra advanced algorithm:
- "If line is right->go right"
- "If line is left->go left"
- "If line is in the middle->go forward"
- "If there is no line, do the last manuever(right or left)"

The wheels move independently, turning the car using the concept of "One wheel moves, the other stops"
